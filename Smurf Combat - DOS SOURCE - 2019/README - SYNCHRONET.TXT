Synchronet Sysops:

 We believe that we have come to a point in time where Bulletin Board Systems
 have become so dynamic  that it is  now completely impossible to 'perfectly'
 accomodate every single BBS system out there.

 This version of Smurf Combat has been tested on  everything including  WWiV,
 Wildcat, Synchronet, Tag, SearchLight, Major, etc... and we have come to the
 conclusion that if it isn't broke why fix it?

 In otherwords ..... the Synchronet  version  of Smurf Combat  is now  in the
 circular file.  Sorry if we caused you any problems, but this version should
 work fine, as its been successfully tested on Synchronet.
